          Are you a grandparent?<br>
          Do you love your grandchildren?<br><br>
  
          If you answered yes, then <u>you</u> must continue reading<br><br>
          You know that technology is constantly changing and you often feel left behind…<br><br>

          Which has led you to feel frustrated and sometimes leaves you with the desire to break your technology…<br><br>

          They tell you that technology makes things easier, faster and better and you haven’t found that to be true<br><br> 

          Corporations and governments keep adding more technology to everything<br><br>
          Its like they are trying to get rid of human beings<br><br>

          Would you like to know why?<br>
          That’s because it saves them a whole lot of money<br><br>

          They don’t mind investing millions in the latest gizmo to save money yet they’re not investing in YOU<br><br>

          They never show you how to actually work these new “improvements”<br>
          Unfortunately they don’t care, they expect you to just figure it out all on your own <br><br>

          It's like being told that driving to a store that is 4 miles away is “easier and faster” than walking, which is true, the problem is…<br><br>

          <span><p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">You Weren’t Taught How To Drive</p></span><br><br>

          No only will that mode of transportation not be “easier and faster” than walking...<br><br>

          You are also risking your life and the life of others<br><br>

          The average american is spending 4 hours a day on their cellphones and that number is even higher for those between the ages of 10 to 24 <br><br>

          Some kids are spending 12 hours on their devices a day<br>
          12 HOURS A DAY...that’s a lot!<br><br>

          There’s a lot of good on the internet…<br><br>

          The biggest one…children now, have access to most of human knowledge at their fingertips<br><br> 

          They can stay connected to their whomever wherever they may be on the planet<br>
          They can stay connected to you, if you learn technology…<br><br>

          Problem is…<br><br>

          <span><p style="font-weight: bold;">There’s also a lot of evil on the internet…</p></span>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span style="background-color: #FFFF3A;">Reddit, a website that your grandchild visits for four hours a day, is full of children telling
                other children what to do.</span> The average person on Reddit is below the age of 22. <br>
              Those are the people that are influencing your grandkids. <br>
              People that barely have any life experiences. It’s like bringing your grandkids<br>
              to a school where all the teachers are between the ages of 16-20, with a principal that is 22. <br>
              How well do you think they will turn out?
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="background-color: #FFFF3A;">Anti-Capitalism, Pro-Communist propaganda is rampant on the internet. </span>
              There’s a lot of people creating memes that are being shared across the internet on how communism is somehow “good.” The form of government that has killed millions and left many more in poverty. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="background-color: #FFFF3A;">Suicide rates have gone up in children and young adults. </span>
              Suicide rates have gone up in children and young adults. From 2011 to 2021 13% of highschool girls 
              have attempted suicide and 30% have strongly considered it. That’s the epidemic following our youth.
               Many girls are spending a lot of time on social media comparing themselves to others feeling 
               like they aren't good. Overall teens are suffering.  
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="background-color: #FFFF3A;">The Rise Of Liberalism.</span>
              On the internet conservatism hardly exists. The few places that it exists, liberals are trying to bury it. There are multiple ways they do that. The first by simply screaming as loud as possible. The second by suppressing the voice of conservatives. The third, and maybe their favorite way, vilifying conservatives. They want to take away the principles that you wish to instill on your family. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="background-color: #FFFF3A;">LGBT+ Influence is rampant.</span>
              It's being celebrated all over the internet. Which would have been fine, 
              if they did not make people that weren’t part of the LGBT+ feel guilty for being themselves, 
              or trying to make everyone feel like they might be gay or trans. In highschool, 
              my friend’s sister decided that she was now a boy. My friend told me that it was 
              just a phase that she was going through because of the influence of the internet. 
              At the time I wanted to be supportive and referred to her as “he.” 
              Turns out my friend was right. It was only happening because of the people on the internet. 
              She was back to being a girl just a few months later. 
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          
           
          

          Those are only some of the battles that your grandchildren are facing whenever you see their noses in their phones and computers<br><br>

          The problem is...<br><br>

          You can't stop them from using technology…<br><br>

          That's where the world is headed. It's how they do their school work, that's how they learn now, they just need you there with them…<br><br>

          Remember when they were younger, they needed supervision to cross the street so that they wouldn't get hit by a car…<br><br>

          They still need you… maybe even more now<br><br>

          Right now they are walking head down straight into the digital highway that has data going over 200 MBP per second…<br><br>

          They are walking head down because they don't understand the dangers…<br><br>

          while their seeing grandparent is simply watching them walk right into the busy traffic without even moving a finger<br><br>

          That’s unfortunately what was happening before…You were blind<br>
          Now you know…and thankfully you can help them now…<br><br>

          You may think…<br>
          “I can’t do it”<br><br>

          Either because you think you are too “old” or because you don’t want to break anything<br><br>

          There’s some good news for you…<br>
          You being “old” is actually an advantage that your grandchildren do not have<br><br>

          You may think that kids are naturally good at technology, they are not. They are simply not scared of breaking whatever is in front of them to get what they want…<br><br>

          Your Grandchildren Learn Technology The Expensive Way<br><br>

          If your grandchild wants to use YouTube, they will click any and all buttons on the computer until they either A) find YouTube or B) break the computer<br><br>

          It’s not their fault, they’re young, they don't always know how to communicate<br><br>

          they’re not patient and for those young enough… they don't even know how to read!<br><br>

          You on the other hand know how to communicate your desires, you know how to be patient (life forced that lesson unto you) and you know how to read<br><br>

          You have those advantages, you just underestimate them and overestimate the youth’s ability to get what they want by impatiently smashing any and all buttons until they get it right or destroy it in the pursuit<br><br> 

          You will be able to get what you want out of technology and even outperform 99% of the world in technology..<br><br>

          You just need a teacher to guide you along the way and practice…<br>
          That’s why the “Tech Master” Certificate was created for you<br><br>

          You have two ways to learn with a structure curriculum:<br> 
          Going to college, or earning your “Tech Master” Certificate<br><br>

          Can you imagine how annoying it would be to have a roommate…
          A college freshman tasting freedom for the first time 

          Their first taste of freedom is the start of your hell
          Your roommate goes to sleep at 2 a.m. and alway has friends over

          Everyday you have the hear the screeching that your roommate calls music<br>
          Sleeping on the stiff bottom bunker…<br><br>

          Which your roommate was at least kind enough to volunteer it to you<br>
          You didn’t want to be the senior who fell off a top bunker in a college dorm<br><br>

          That would be…embarrassing and…dangerous<br><br>

          Your roommate isn’t a bad person, so when asked<br>
          “Can we increase the temperature? I can’t sleep at the current temperature”<br><br>

          You answered…"yes"<br><br>

          That yes sealed your fate…<br>
          Now you wake up in sweat…every night<br><br>

          Doesn’t sound fun, right?<br><br>

          Not only is not fun, it is costly<br>
          Learning the traditional way takes way too much time and costs you, well your lifestyle<br><br>

          College will cost you 4 years of your life studying and...<br>
          it Will cost you over $100,000 to downgrade your lifestyle for those 4 years<br><br>

          College takes too much time, and decreases your quality of life<br><br>

          Instead by joining our certificate program, you will learn the skill not in 4 years…<br>
          you will learn it in 4 months…<br><br>

          *you don’t get access to the “Billion Dollar App” Mastermind (value of $120,000)<br><br>			 	 
          Ask yourself this question…<br><br>

          <span>
            <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">
              “Is my grandchildren’s lives worth investing only a couple hours a
              month and $33,999 to learn technology?”
            </p>
          </span>

          If you answered yes…<br>
